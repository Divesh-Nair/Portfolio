My name is Divesh Nair. I currently live in Johannesburg, South Africa. I have just finished my degree from the University of Witwatersrand. My degree is a BA in Digital Arts with a Major in game design and Psychology.  

​

Over the years I have been working on my artistic skills. I have been creating art from a young age. I attended art classes for 7 years where I learnt how to draw, sculpt and paint. This includes oil, watercolour and acrylic. Some of my art is attached below. 



During my four years in University, I have developed my 3D skills. I have worked with Unity, Blender, Zbrush, Photoshop, After Effects and a little bit of Maya. I also know the basics of C# and visual studio from creating some games.
